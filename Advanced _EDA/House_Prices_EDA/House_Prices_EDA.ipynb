However, an in-depth and broad exploratory data analysis (EDA) can help a lot to understand your dataset, get a feeling for how things are connected and what needs to be done to properly process your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This NB will explore multiple useful EDA routines. However, to keep things short and compact it might not always dig deeper or explain all of the implications. But, spending enough time on a proper EDA to fully understand a dataset is a key part of any good data science project.\n",
